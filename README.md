# New Atlantis

> Collection of goals for using AI to support a better future for humanity.

New Atlantis is a living charter for how advanced AI should be used to increase human flourishing rather than hollow it out.

This repository is not a product spec, policy whitepaper, or marketing document. It is a set of concrete visions of a future we desire, that through AI enablement and human effort can be accomplished at civilizational scale.

## Why this exists

Modern AI is being deployed faster than we are articulating what “good”, "useful", and "beneficial" look like.

Most discussions stay at the level of vague virtues (“safe”, “aligned”, “beneficial”) or narrow metrics (benchmarks, revenue, engagement). That’s not enough.

New Atlantis aims to:

- Make the *ends* explicit: what kinds of futures we are actually trying to build.
- Decompose those ends into **concrete, actionable goals**.
- Empower others to connect those goals to **technical, institutional, and cultural levers**.

If AGI/ASI is inevitable, then the question is not “whether” but **what we are steering toward**.

---

This repository focuses on goals and frameworks rather than implementation details.

It covers:

- Clear, structured statements about desired states of the world enabled or shaped by AI.

It intentionally avoids:

- Product-specific roadmaps for any one company.
- Short-term “growth hacks” or purely commercial objectives.
- Detailed legal drafting (though it may inform it).

## Repository structure

Planned structure (only some directories may exist initially):

- `README.md`  
  This document.

- `VISION.md`  
  High-level picture of the AI-augmented civilization we want.

- `PRINCIPLES.md`  
  Non-negotiable constraints and design values.

- `goals/`  
  Canonical goals, each in its own Markdown file:
  - `goals/index.md` — overview and taxonomy
  - `goals/health/cancer-cure.md`
  - `goals/health/alzheimers-prevention.md`
  - `goals/education/global-education-access.md`
  - `goals/humanity/resilient-societal-infrastructure.md`
  - `goals/humanity/flourishing-society.md`
  - `goals/planet/solve-climate-change.md`

## How to read and use this repository

Different people can use this in different ways:

- **Builders / engineers**
  - Use the goals as constraints when designing systems, agents, and infrastructure.
  - Reference them in design docs: “This feature advances Goal X and conflicts with Goal Y.”

- **Researchers**
  - Treat each goal as a source of research questions.
  - Map existing literature and open problems under each.

- **Policy and governance people**
  - Lift goals and structure as input into regulation, charters, standards, and institutional design.
  - Anchor debates in concrete desired outcomes, not abstract slogans.

- **Foundations, philanthropies, and investors**
  - Use the goal catalog as a north star for funding and prioritization.
  - Ask: “Which goals does this project move, and how will we know?”

## Goal format

Each goal file in `goals/` follows a common template:

- **Name**
- **Status** (Idea / Draft / Refining / Stable)
- **Problem**
- **Goal**
- **Non-goals**
- **Why this matters**
- **Sub-goals / milestones**
- **Example initiatives**
- **Risks and tradeoffs**
- **Dependencies and interfaces** (with other goals)

This is meant to stay high-level enough to be widely reusable, and concrete enough that progress can be assessed.

## Contributing

This is a curated, evolving collection. Contributions are welcome! They should:

- Engage with the existing structure instead of adding noise.
- Be explicit: what goal is being added or modified, and why?
- Include tradeoffs and failure modes, not just benefits.
- Aim for long-term value, not news-cycle reactions.
- Most importantly: think BIG!

If you open an issue or pull request, reference the relevant goal(s) and explain how your change tightens or improves them.
